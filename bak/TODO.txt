* [DONE] Both transcend and intercom servers do NOT respect security keywords,  anyone can retrieve
  [DONE]  revision 1425.

* [NOT reproduced] 'trans -p -aus <file>' is different from 'trans -p  <file>'  the first one does not compress files
  [WORKED] Investigated and it worked: (tested with transcend only)
                * dev clients against production servers
                * dev clients against dev servers

* [DONE ]Check routes for keywords (get)  -> trans -f with 'E' and 'e' should reach Intercom server not Transcend server.

* [DONE] Check route for put  and differences from get

* [DONE] test clients parallel transfers on both Linux and Solaris (transcend and icom)
   - client and servers on production work: parallel put, serial get
   - dev client against production :        parallel put, serial get
   - dev client against dev servers:        parallel put, serial get

   - simulating a server redirection:       parallel put, (get not performed)
        scenario:
             * Redirect Transcend server listeing on port 6928
                 nxa13339 14327     1  0 10:00 pts/3    00:00:00 /proj/dmisw/mdsdev/work/b35201/MDS_repository/trans_br_nxp/RELEASE_DIR/ssl.transcend -8
             * Primary server listening on 6923 with ssl.company_table redirecting "idc Noida" to Redirect Transcend server:
                 such as:  "Noida;idc;awv120831.nxdi.us-cdc01.nxp.com;10.232.5.13;6928;Transcend;0;no;no;yes"  (ip not changed)

* [DONE] one of these generatd secure keywords does not have data in the database even trans -i works
  [DONE] revision 1425.
         Only Intercom used to save data_transfer.dt_keyword_mapping, now all servers do.
         db_admin/keyword_file is still used

      Transcend server:
                   trans.localhost.debug -web twg02362 -p README.txt ryan.huang@nxp.com twg02362

                   trans.localhost.debug -web twg02362 -p README.txt sileno.rocco@nxp.com  twg02362

* [NOT reproduced using SVN revision 1452] investigate why global_data/keyword saves different "Site":
     zoeh8359t:Site:        Mazieri
     zqeo6725t:Site:        s-cdc01.nxp.com
     umgj2352t:Site:        Mazieri
     uslb3856e:Site:        External
     vdyt7175e:Site:        Externa

     Perhaps it was not an issue, just observed in a test environment.


* [DONE] sending a file to specific person using core/wbi id at domain example: "trans -p <file> nxa13339@nxp.com" does not convert to real user/email.

* [DONE] new server just released from SVN revision 1432 do not work "trans -q"
   received the message: Warning -545:  No file keywords found for 'carlos.mazieri@nxp.com' in the freescale.net repository.
   [DONE] revision 1453.

* [DONE] 'trans -g' or 'trans -i' fails for external keywords 'E' or 'e'
  The WRONG_SERVER implementation solves that.

* [DONE] sending a secure keyword to coreid i.e, 'b35201' does work when getting with wbi id i.e,'nxa13339'
         [DONE] revision 1451.
         coreid@anything is handled by the server at the moment it comes from the client.
         email is saved instead of coreid in the table dt_keyword_mapping

* [DONE]  when listing  repositories include the abbreviation like aus, dtms, etc

* [DONE] Test auto register (two cases in two months where it fails)
         On revision 1504 it has been improved.

* [DONE] investigate and fix duplicated 'secure keyword'
         [DONE] on revision 1506
               Error -737:    Received error code 1062 from mySql query:

               'insert into dt_keyword_mapping     (secure_keyword, file_keyword, description, from_email, to_email,  upload_date, download_date) values("pina6925E", "ttqt0250e", "Data transfer on Thu Sep  6 08:04:55 2018", "mark.hawkins@nxp.com", "cad-us@compugraphics.com", "18/09/06 08:04:55", "")'

               Error string returned is:

               'Duplicate entry 'pina6925E' for key 'secure_keyword'

* [DONE] It looks like an external customer can send data to another external customer
       RELEASE_DIR/icom.ext -p -rtc TODO.txt (it works)  -> perhaps it should not (check for EXTERNAL and -destination like -rtc)

       [DONE] data is sent but no email is sent to people from other companies, it behaves like no company was specified.

* [DONE] Get Delete "-G" does not delete the file.
    [DONE] on revisions, 1511 1537 and 1538.


* [DONE] Get parallel does not work => put on parallel transfers (due by size) should get as parallel.
    [DONE] released on revision 1543.


* avoid "shared memory" when doing parallel transfer,  change approach to use "multi-thread" instead of "multi-process".
   [DONE] 'shared mmemory' has been replaced by a file solution on 'clients' only [revisions 1554  1555  1558].


* [DONE] Automated Tests improvements:
    * "Automated Tests" add check for Put rows in dt_tranfertimes.
    * "Automated Tests" add check for clients return code first
    * "Automated Tests" add possibilty of a test be expected to fail
    * "Automated Tests" add possibilty of a test have others way of check pass/fail


* [DONE] external icom needs a feature to generate '.icomrc'  -> -icomrc -> generates '.icomrc' in the home directory
    [DONE] on revision 1638.


* [DONE] trans -x and icom -x uses hard coded list, change to get from the sever.
    [DONE] on revision 1642.


* [PARTIALLY DONE]
  --Unify configuration files "db_admin/ssl.company_table",  "db_admin/ssl.transcend_company_extension", "db_admin/company_extension"  and "db_admin/ftp_mapping" to use the table 'dt_destinations'
      [PARTIALLY] db_admin/ftp_mapping not removed, others were removed.
  --[TODO] Unify the terms 'repository' and 'site' from boh servers and clients to 'destination'
  --[TODO] The structure TRANS_COMPANY in 'trans_include/company.h' should be used and the TRANS_REPOSITORY can be removed or an alias to TRANS_COMPANY.
  --[DONE] In the server the 'main daemon' can read this table every 5 minutes before forking new instances to avoid many MySQL access. Like this:

        time_t last_destination_update = (time_t)0;
        ....
         time_t time_before_fork = time(NULL);
         if ( (time_before_fork - last_destination_update) >= 300) // 5 minutes
         {
              load_destination_table() // into a global variable, other instances can use it
              last_destination_update = time_before_fork;
         }
         fork();

  incident: INC0967771
  
    *  trans -P <file> works only for a single receiver, more than one receiver it does not get deleted.


* trans -gz  MUST perform parallel transfer [new reported by Bill Johnson]

* trans -T (does not work) -t -> follow links and delete after first download.

* Avoid sending emails for secure keywords.

* secure keyword with email and without @nxp does not work, user cannot access the secure keyword:
    $ trans -p <file> carlos.mazieri   (not carlos.mazieri@nxp.com)

* Study the possibility of removing shared memory on servers as well as it has done by clients.

* trans -d deletes any keyword from any user -> check owner

* Unify  client code => 'trans' universal client => 'icom' only external.

* Unify servers      => 'Transcend'  'Intercom'  'TransFTP'    => perhaps:   'Intercom' + 'Send2Foundry'.

* Dismiss not used code all client and servers

* trans -B fails to list the entire content  if there is a file name of directory name containing spaces


* Implement 'trans-auto-update' to 'update server' versions and 'configuration files'
     - Servers needs to have a crontab running, that script from crontab checks it is available on that server a keyword for 'db_admin' user using 'trans -web <user> -q <site>'
     - Updates can activated by sending the new file (binary or configuration file) to that specific site/user with auto-delete.
       Example:   echo 'new relase of ssl.transcend revision 1467"  | trans -P -phx <file> db_admin@phx-trans.nxdi.nxp.com"
                  1. The script on Phoenix will detect this the secure keyword above
                  2. The script reads the description and matches with file name, then kills transcend, retrieve the keyword, copy it and starts new trancend version.

* trans -web can be interactive, it opens the prompt to inform parameters: (hide string -web and perhaps power users to the client)
      trans -web -p file size
      > user

       When putting files, the content of file can be inputed by stdin, which would be used for both transweb internal and external turning Intercom.so obsolete

      trans -web -g keyword (still see the keyword in ps which is good)
      > user


* Investigate the ERROR:
     Error -350:    Unable to open for read database file:

               'releases/releases'

     --  Message generated by Transcend server on inv0803.nxdi.us-cdc01.nxp.com


* Investigate the ERROR: file was not present in repository, looks like there si an entry in database, but no data was found:
    Error -509:    File sent to Transcend repository was not the correcct size.

                   File name:  sn2_n23x_000000_full.gds.gz

    [1]  [ more investigations are necessary ]


* trans -C -xio files => active Cron-Delete for Internal Intercom server seems to not worked


* Check if a external customer is able to get a 'file keyword'  (of course use external icom client)


* Investigate the message:
     Could not log message 'mkqz9384t' in file 'user_keys/'
