<h1>Hands-on Transcend tool</h1>
<br>

<p align='justify'>
<b>Transcend</b> is NXP’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_file_transfer">Managed File Transfer</a>.
    It is widely used by R&amp;D, Applications Engineering and Marketing teams to exchange information.
    While primarily focused on the Linux environment, clients are also
    available for Windows, Solaris and the Web.  In production for many years,
    users tend to find <b>Transcend</b> more convenient than ftp, scp, or rsync
    solutions for data exchange and around 20,000 transfers per month are
    performed using the tool.  Secure data repositories are distributed
    world-wide to optimize data posting and retrieval. 
</p>

<p align='justify'>
    When the user <em>transcends</em> data, the data is securely posted to the repository.
    A nine character keyword is generated for data retrieval.  Two forms of
    transfer are supported:  general transfer where anyone who has the keyword is
    able to retrieve the data and secure transfer where the keyword is locked to
    the sender and targeted recipient email addresses.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
    A <b>Transcend</b> repository is available in each NXP site as distributed in the
    following table.  Regional repositories are used improve <b>Transcend</b> user
    responsiveness.  The 9th character of the keyword indicates the Repository
    where <b>Transcend</b> data is stored.

    By default, each transfer is available during 3 days. After this 3 days a
    ‘get’ attempt using the keyword will return an error indicating that the data
    is no longer available. A special <b>Transcend</b> option allows to extend a
    keyword’s lifetime for up to 3 additional days.

    The <b>Transcend</b> family of tools are under Freescale active 
    development since 1994, helping in the engineering flow. 
    Now <b>Transcend</b> is part of the NXP portfolio of tools. 
    <b>Transcend</b> is available on Linux, Solaris, Windows and 
    others platforms using TransWeb.
