<p><b> Version 8.4 of Transcend (Released on May 15, 2013) </b></p>

<p> We are pleased to announce the production release of version
8.4 of Transcend.  The purpose for this release is  to  move
the  primary  Transcend server from Phoenix to Austin and to
shut down the Phoenix servers.  This is being done  as  part
of the EC consolidation to Austin.  The Phoenix aliases have
been modified to point to the Austin Transcend server.  How-
ever,  the  alias  changes  may  not  migrate  to all of the
machines on the network.   Customers  who  do  not  see  the
updated aliases must migrate to the new release.</p>

<p>The  release  has been uploaded to the MTR with package name
fs-transcend-/8.4.  The software can also be downloaded from
our  web  site: http://transcend.freescale.net or with Tran-
scend  using  the  -r  option.   It  is  also   present   in
