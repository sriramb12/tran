<h2>Where are the Transcend repositories?</h2>
<P> 
    Transcend supports seven Transcend repositories - WROC, Tempe, Austin, Munich, India,
    External Transweb Customer and DTMS.
</p>

<h2>Are there any transfer Sizes and/or Limitations?</h2>
<p>
    Transcend supports the transfer of files, directories, 
    and groups of files greater than 2 GB in size.
</p>

<p>The following limitation is present:
<UL TYPE="DISC">
    <li>
        During directory transfer, Transcend uses gtar or gnutar to bundle/unbundle the data
        if it is present on the customer's machine. Otherwise, tar is used.
     </li>
     <li>
        Incompatibilities are sometimes present if the sender of the data has gtar installed
        on their machine, and the receiver does not have gtar installed on their machine.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers can avoid this problem by using version 6.3 of Transcend. If the receiver
        has a previous release, he can avoid this problem by installing gtar on his machine.
    </li>
    <li>
	  Customers may also force the use of tar instead of gtar by using the
	  '-pt' and '-gt' options when putting and getting data respectively.
	</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<h2>Is there anything in the 9 character keywords Transcend generates to indicate  where the data is stored?</h2>
<P>
    The ninth character of the keyword specifies where Transcend data is stored.
    The letters 'w', 'a', 't', 'n', 'm', 'z', 'd', and 'e' indicate data is stored at the
    WROC, Austin, Tempe, Israel, India, Munich, Brazil, DTMS, and External TransWeb sites respectively.
</P>

<h2>Is there a configuration file that can be used to configure Transcend options? </h2>
<P>
    Some options can be configured using the .transrc file. When this file is present in your home directory,
    Transcend uses this file to change default options. You can retrieve a copy of the .transrc file by typing 'trans -r .transrc'.
<P>

<h2>Can I configure Transcend so that data is always transferred to a specific repository?</h2>
<P>
    The default site data is transferred to can be set in the .transrc file. The keywords 'Site1', 'Site2', 'Site3', and 'Site4',
    are used for the primary, secondary, tertiary, and fourth sites respectively. The easiest way to change the default site is to simply
    change the number in the site keyword to a different value.
</p>
<P>
    For example, to change the default site from Tempe to WROC, change 'Site1' to 'Site2', and 'Site2' to 'Site1'.
    If two lines are set to 'Site1', the last line encountered in the file will be used for the primary site.
    A 'trans.log' file is created when data is transcended to the data repository.
</P>

<h2>What can I do to prevent Transcend from creating this file?</h2>
<P>
    You can change the location for the 'trans.log' file in the .transrc file. the keyword 'Log Directory' specifies where the 'trans.log' file is placed.
    Use the values '~', '.', and 'None' to set the log directory to your home directory, your current directory, or no directory respectively.
</P>
<P>
    When transferring data, Transcend prints a status message to the screen each time 4 Mb of data is transferred.
</P>

<h2>How can I keep Transcend from printing so many status messages to the screen?</h2>
<p>
    By default, Transcend prints the status of data transferred when 4 Mb of data are transferred
    or when 30 seconds have elapsed, which ever comes first. However, the increment for when 
    the status is printed to the screen can be altered by changing the value for the Print by time keyword.
</P>
<p>
    You can change the default from 4 to any other number. For example, if you change the number from 4 to 33, Transcend will print the status
    each time 33 Mb of data is transferred. You can also change the amount of time that must elapse before a status message is printed to the screen
    by altering the value for the 'PrintByTime' keyword. For example, you can change the value from 30 seconds to 120 seconds.
