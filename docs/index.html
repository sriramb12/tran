        <h2>What is Transcend?</h2>

        <p align='justify'>
            <b>Transcend (Transfer/Send Data)</b> is the NXP's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_file_transfer">Managed File Transfer</a>
            solution. It is widely used by R&amp;D, Applications Engineering and Marketing teams 
            to exchange information.  While primarily focused on the Linux environment, clients 
            are also available for Windows, Solaris and the Web. In production for many years, 
            users tend to find transcend more convenient than ftp, scp, or rsync solutions for
            data exchange and around 20,000 transfers per month are performed using the tool.
            Secure data repositories are distributed world-wide to optimize data posting and 
            retrieval. 
        </p>

        <p align='justify'>
            When the user transcends data, the data is securely posted to the
            repository. A nine character keyword is generated for data retrieval.
            Two forms of transfer are supported:  general transfer where anyone
            who has the keyword is able to retrieve the data and secure transfer
            where the keyword is locked to the sender and targeted recipient email
            addresses.
        </p>

        <p align='justify'>
            Transcend offers a higher level of security and control. Transcend uses secure socket connection
            (<a href="https://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>) to perform serial and parallel file transfer 
            offering end-to-end encryption. Others features include notification of successful file transfers, 
            auditability, and worldwide visibility.
        </p>

        <p align=' justify'>
            Transcend tool have been widely used for data transfer between the worldwide sites, and is 
            now available for whole NXP company. Transcend was first released for production 
            use in July of 1994, and have been under continuos development from 22 years, currently being 
            used by around 5000 users.
